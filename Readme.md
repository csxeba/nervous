# Nervous documentation
Nervous is an implementation of the StressedNet evolutionary Artificial Neural Network pruning technique.
It is currently only able to wrap Keras, but it might become backend-independent in the future.

StressedNet is described in the following four papers (in chronological and logical order):

[EvoNet (2016)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1606.04393.pdf)

[Cluster EvoNet (2016)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1609.01360.pdf)

[Transgenerational EvoNet (2017)](http://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_ICCV_2017_workshops/papers/w18/Shafiee_Learning_Efficient_Deep_ICCV_2017_paper.pdf)

[StressedNet (2018)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1801.05387.pdf)

The library is currently WIP.
